INSTALLATION                                            *tagalong-installation*

The easiest way to install the plugin is with a plugin manager:

- vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
- Vundle:   https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

If you use one, just follow the instructions in its documentation.

You can install the plugin yourself using Vim's |packages| functionality by
cloning the project (or adding it as a submodule) under
`~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/start/`. For example:
>
    git clone https://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagalong.vim ~/.vim/pack/_/start/tagalong
<
This should automatically load the plugin for you on Vim start. Alternatively,
you can add it to `~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/opt/` instead and load it in your
.vimrc manually with:
>
    packadd tagalong
<
If you'd rather not use git, you can download the files from the "releases"
tab and unzip them in the relevant directory:
https://github.com/AndrewRadev/tagalong.vim/releases.

USAGE                                                          *tagalong-usage*

The plugin is designed to automatically rename closing HTML/XML tags when
editing opening ones (or the other way around). For the most part, you should
be able to edit your code normally (see below for limitations) and the plugin
would take care of the renaming once you leave insert mode.

Apart from HTML tags, it'll also detect XML-style `<namespaced:tags>` and
react-style `<Component.Subcomponents>`.

The plugin only activates for HTML-like buffers, or at least all the ones that
I could think of. You can see the full list in the setting
|g:tagalong_filetypes|. You can set that variable yourself to limit it to the
ones you use. You can activate the plugin for more filetypes by changing
|g:tagalong_additional_filetypes| (but consider opening an issue to suggest
changes to the default list). See |tagalong-settings| for more details.

Features and Limitations ~

Not every method of changing the tag can be intercepted, or it might be too
complicated or too invasive to do so. Here's the methods that work with the
plugin:

- `c`: Anything involving a `c` operation, including `cw`, `ci<`, `cE`, or `C`.
- `v` + `c`: Selecting anything in visual mode and changing it with a `c`.
- `i`, `a`: Entering insert mode and making direct changes.

For all of these, the cursor needs to be within the `<>` angle brackets of the
tag. If you change it from the outside, like with a `C` starting at the
opening angle bracket, the plugin won't be activated.

A few examples of making a change that WON'T trigger the plugin:

- Using the `:substitute` command, for instance `:%s/<div /<span /g`.
- Yanking some text and pasting it over.
- Using the `r` or `x` mappings to change/delete one character.
- Entering insert mode outside of the tag, navigating to it and changing it.

Some of these might be implemented at a later time, but others might be too
difficult or too invasive. If you often use a method that doesn't trigger the
plugin, consider opening a github issue to discuss it.

Also note that the plugin relies on the |InsertLeave| autocommand to detect
when to apply the change. If you exit insert mode via <c-c>, that won't be
triggered. This is a good way to avoid the automatic behaviour, but if you
commonly exit insert mode this way, it can be a problem. See
|tagalong-internals| for help.

You can disable the plugin for particular mappings by overriding the
|g:tagalong_mappings| variable. See |tagalong-settings| for details. You can
also disable it explicitly by calling the command |:TagalongDeinit|, and
later re-enable it with |:TagalongInit|. This could be quite useful if you run
into a bug and the buffer gets messed up!

Large files can also be a problem. With a 100,000-line XML file and tags that
wrap its entirety, the plugin really takes time, even during normal editing
within a tag. To avoid this, its operation has been limited to 500
milliseconds, configurable via the |g:tagalong_timeout| variable. This means,
unfortunately, that in said large file, closing tags may not be reliably
updated. This should be rare, hopefully.

With |g:tagalong_verbose| turned on, you'll get a message that the matching
tag was NOT updated if the search for it times out. Alternatively, you can set
|g:tagalong_timeout| to 0 for no timeout and, if you see a dramatic slowdown,
use <c-c> and run |:TagalongDeinit| to disable the plugin. You could implement
an automatic solution by checking the value of `line('$')`.

If you have vim-repeat (https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) installed, you
can repeat the last tag change with the |.| operator.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                     *tagalong-settings*

                                                          *g:tagalong_filetypes*
>
    let g:tagalong_filetypes = ['html']
<
Default value: [
    "html", "xml", "jsx", "eruby", "ejs", "eco", "php", "htmldjango"
]

This variable holds all of the filetypes that the plugin will install mappings
for. If, for some reason, you'd like to avoid its behaviour for particular
markup languages, you can set the variable to a list of the ones you'd like to
keep.

To add more filetypes, check out |g:tagalong_additional_filetypes| below.

If you set it to an empty list, `[]`, the plugin will not be automatically
installed for any filetypes, but you can activate it yourself by calling
the `tagalong#Init()` function in a particular buffer.

                                               *g:tagalong_additional_filetypes*
>
    let g:tagalong_additional_filetypes = ['custom', 'another']
<
Default value: []

The plugin should work with any HTML-like tags, so if a compatible filetype is
missing in |g:tagalong_filetypes|, you can add it here. Or you can call the
`tagalong#Init()` function in your buffer.

Ideally, the above setting would just hold all sensible filetypes, so consider
opening a github issue to suggest one that you feel is missing. As long as
it's not something too custom, I would likely be okay with adding it to the
built-in list.

                                     *g:tagalong_excluded_filetype_combinations*
>
    let g:tagalong_excluded_filetype_combinations = ['custom.html']
<
Default value: ['eruby.yaml']

This setting allows the exclusion of particular filetype dot-combinations from
initialization. The "filetypes" setting includes single filetypes, so any
combination of them including, for instance, "html" would activate the plugin.
So you could set custom filetypes like "html.rails" or something and it would
still work.

That said, there are combinations that are not HTML-like. The current default
value of the setting, "eruby.yaml" is a good example -- it's being set by
vim-rails, but there's no HTML to edit in there.

It's recommended to leave this setting untouched, but you could use it as an
escape hatch. If you have any problems with a particular filetype that are solved
by an entry in this setting, consider opening an issue to make a change to the
defaults.

                                                           *g:tagalong_mappings*
>
    let g:tagalong_mappings = [{'c': '_c'}, 'i', 'a']
<
Default value: ['c', 'C', 'v', 'i', 'a']

This setting controls which types of editing will have mappings installed for
them. Currently, these are literal mappings -- each character in the list is a
mapping that you can see by executing `:nmap c`, for instance. But it's not
necessary to be the case -- in the future, the values in the list might be
labels of some sort that will be explained in more detail in the
documentation.

Changing this variable means that editing the buffer with the removed mappings
won't trigger the plugin. You could set it to `['i', 'a']` if you usually edit
tags by entering insert mode and backspacing over the tag. That way, the `c`
family of mappings could be used as an escape hatch, if the plugin bugs out or
you have good reason not to update the other tag.

Note that the plugin will attempt to respect your previous mappings of any of
these keys. If you have an `nnoremap c` in your `.vimrc` file, it'll be
applied. Mapping `cw`, on the other hand, will likely just use your mapping,
instead of hitting the plugin at all. If you're having problems with this,
please open a github issue.

If you want to use a special key sequence to replace a built-in, you can put a
dictionary instead of a single letter in the setting. For instance, instead of
`'c'`, you can put in `{'c': '_c'}`, and it would use the `_c` key sequence
to act as the native `c` key with tagalong's effect. You can use that to avoid
conflicts with other plugins overriding the native keys. It's generally not
recommended -- the power of the plugin is that it works automatically,
otherwise you could use vim-surround instead. But it's your call.

If you set the variable to an empty list, `[]`, the plugin will not be
activated by any mappings, but you can read the |tagalong-internals| section
for some advanced ways of using it.

                                                            *g:tagalong_verbose*
>
    let g:tagalong_verbose = 1
<
Default value: 0

If you set this value to 1, the plugin will print out a message every time it
auto-updates a closing/opening tag. Could be useful if you'd like to be sure
the change was made, especially if it's offscreen. If editing a particularly
large file and the plugin times out, you'll get a message for that, too.

                                                            *g:tagalong_timeout*
>
    let g:tagalong_timeout = 200
<
Default value: 500

The maximum time the plugin is allowed to search for a matching tag pair. You
can set this to 0 to have no timeout, but operations can be very slow in large
files (100,000 lines of XML seems to cause around 2s of lag when entering
insert mode).


==============================================================================
INTERNALS                                                   *tagalong-internals*
                                                            *:TagalongInit*
                                                            *:TagalongDeinit*

The plugin installs its mappings with the function `tagalong#Init()` which can
be directly called with the command `:TagalongInit`. All mappings and
variables initialized are buffer-local. Instead of using
|g:tagalong_filetypes|, you can actually just put `TagalongInit` at the top of
`~/.vim/ftplugin/<your-filetype>.vim`, and it should work. Or you can come up
with some other criteria to activate it.

You can manually deactivate the plugin for the buffer with the
`:TagalongDeinit` command, which takes care to unmap its keybindings and clear
its autocommands.

All the mappings (currently) do the following:

- Call the `tagalong#Trigger()` function. It stores information about the tag
  under the cursor in a buffer-local variable.

- Execute the original mapping.

- Upon exiting insert mode (see |InsertLeave|), the function
  `tagalong#Apply()` gets called, takes the stored tag information and gets
  the changed tag and applies the change to both opening and closing tag

- The `tagalong#Reapply()` function can be invoked by vim-repeat, or it can be
  invoked manually, to perform the previous tag change.

So, if you wanted to make pasting over a tag activate the plugin, it might work like this:
>
    " The `<c-u>` removes the current visual mode, so a function can be called
    xnoremap <buffer> p :<c-u>call <SID>Paste()<cr>

    " The <SID> above is the same as the s: here
    function! s:Paste()
        call tagalong#Trigger()

        " gv reselects the previously-selected area, and then we just paste
        normal! gvp

        call tagalong#Apply()
    endfunction
<
This is not a built-in, because it feels a bit invasive, and there's other
plugins (and snippets) that override |p|. Plus, repeating the operation
doesn't seem to quite work. But I hope it's a good example to illustrate how
you could try to build something more complicated with the core functions of
the plugin.

If you commonly exit insert mode via `<c-c>`, the plugin won't be triggered,
but you can take care of that with a mapping, if you'd like:
>
    inoremap <silent> <c-c> <c-c>:call tagalong#Apply()<cr>
<
It's generally not recommended -- `<c-c>` doesn't trigger |InsertLeave|
semi-intentionally, I think, as an "escape hatch". But it depends on how you
use it.
